## About AvaIre

AvaIre is a multipurpose Discord bot made for fun, written in Java, using the [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) library.

## About my End of life (developer's words)

Discord has made a few changes to their API over the years, and on Wednesday, August 31, 2022 they will introduce yet another change that will force bots to use slash commands unless they have been approved for the message content intent, AvaIre has been denied the message content intent meaning that it has to implement a slash command replacement for all of the commands.

The AvaIre project has become stagnant over the years as I've lost interest in maintaining and developing the bot, so with the upcoming requirement of using slash commands that would require a rewrite of large parts of the bot, I've decided to stop hosting the bot altogether.

## So... What now?

A new team of devs decided on their own to recreate the bot, using all the necessary intents, etc., to honor the legacy that this amazing bot has. Our focus is to keep a copy for the community, and release new updates, etc. We hope you like our project!
